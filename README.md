# boggle

Unofficial Boggle-like game. Clone the repository and run the game,

```bash
cd boggle
python boggle.py
```

Unlike traditional Boggle, this game allows you to choose the size of your board and you are scored as a percentage of total words on the board.

## To do

- Add updating countdown timer (difficult as this interferes with word input)
- Replace Q with Qu, but it still only counts as one letter
