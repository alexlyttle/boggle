# boggle
A game written in Python 3.7 which emulates and solves the Boggle board game.

This repository is a work-in-progress and does not represent the intended final package. It started as a coding exercise for myself and has been published here to be shared with those which may be able to offer guidence or general coding advice.

Run boggle.py to play the game (currently in an unfinished, but playable, state).
